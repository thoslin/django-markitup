TODO
====

* cleaner South FakeORM compatibility (make automatic rendered field a
  TextField subclass and have South ignore it)

* add support for multiple markup choices (perhaps integration with
  django-markup)

* add support for .save_markup method (with selection of markup type)

* link to live demo?
